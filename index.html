        <div class="question">What is the biggest planet?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system â€“ 
            more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.
            Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an 
            atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.

            Green anacondas can grow to more than 29 feet, weigh more than 550 pounds, and measure more than 12 inches in diameter. Females are significantly larger than males. Other anaconda species, all from South America and all smaller than the green anaconda, are the yellow, dark-spotted, and Bolivian varieties.

        <div class="question">What is the most venomous snake?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The inland taipan (Oxyuranus microlepidotus) is considered the most venomous snake in the world with a murine LD 50 value of 0.025 mg/kg SC. Ernst and Zug et al. 1996 list a value of 0.01 mg/kg SC, which makes it the most venomous snake in the world in their study too. They have an average venom yield of 44 mg.
